    "instructions": "In a high-stakes medical scenario, you are presented with a detailed case context of a patient suffering from a complex medical condition. Your task is to extract critical information from the case context and accurately fill in the @placeholder token in the query with the most appropriate medical term or treatment based on the provided context. This is essential for ensuring timely and effective patient care. \n\nFor example, given a case context about Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and its associations, if the query states, \"GBS being a postinfectious illness, @placeholder can be considered as an emerging trigger,\" you should provide the correct answer that identifies the emerging trigger related to the case context. \n\nBe thorough in your analysis and ensure that your response is clinically relevant and reflects current medical knowledge.",
