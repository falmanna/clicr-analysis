A trial of dopamine agonist treatment before surgery may offer several advantages, including the potential for tumor shrinkage, which can reduce the size of the dural defect and decrease the risk of meningitis. Additionally, medical therapy may alleviate symptoms related to hyperprolactinaemia, such as reduced libido and gynaecomastia, thereby improving the patient's quality of life.\n\nHowever, there are significant risks involved in delaying surgery. The prolonged presence of a CSF leak increases the likelihood of developing meningitis, which has a mortality rate ranging from 25% to 50%. Moreover, while dopamine agonists can lead to tumor shrinkage and resolution of CSF rhinorrhoea in some cases, this outcome is not guaranteed and may vary based on factors such as the size and invasiveness of the tumor. In our case, the patient's spontaneous resolution of CSF rhinorrhoea following meningitis was a fortunate occurrence, highlighting both the potential benefits and inherent uncertainties associated with medical versus surgical approaches.\n\nTherefore, when discussing the timing of surgery with the patient, it is essential to consider individual factors such as the size and aggressiveness of the tumor, the presence of symptoms like headaches or visual disturbances, and the patient's overall health status. A multidisciplinary team approach, involving endocrinologists, neurosurgeons, and infectious disease specialists, can provide a comprehensive evaluation to determine the most appropriate course of action. Ultimately, the decision should be made collaboratively with the patient, ensuring that all possible options are thoroughly discussed, and informed consent is obtained.", "bcr.12.2009.2598.9": "When planning an invasive investigation in very elderly patients with comorbidities, it is essential to meticulously evaluate the potential benefits against the associated risks. This comprehensive assessment should consider factors such as the patient's overall health status, the severity of their symptoms, and the likelihood of achieving a successful outcome without undue harm. Additionally, involving multidisciplinary teams can provide diverse perspectives on managing both the medical and surgical aspects, ensuring that all possible interventions are weighed against the potential complications. Ultimately, the decision should prioritize the patient's well-being and quality of life, aiming to minimize risks while maximizing the chances of effective treatment.", "bcr.12.2010.3599.15": "line", "bcr.12.2010.3650.9": "Anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) should be recognized as a significant risk factor for cardiovascular complications in young patients.
