Mcmanis et al mentioned six patients with painful neuropathy thought to be secondary to derangement in lipid profile after extensively excluding other causes of neuropathy.

Hou et al highlighted a case of peripheral neuropathy thought to be secondary to hypertriglyceridemia after excluding other pathologies with extensive investigation. Shankar looked at a subgroup of patients with concurrent diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia with peripheral neuropathy and concluded that diabetic sensory neuropathy severity correlates with the severity of hypertriglyceridemia suggesting that the triglycerides augment the neuropathic process. The mechanism of neuropathy secondary to deranged triglyceride level has also been described in the medical literature, with some evidence that the raised triglycerides result in oxidative stress injuries specifically at the dorsal root ganglia neurons, which would explain the process of radiculopathy. It is also hypothesized that high triglyceride levels induce microangiopathy in blood vessels, leading to a lack of blood supply to small nerve fibers, similar to the mechanism seen in diabetic neuropathies. Vincent et al looked at the toxic effect of hypertriglyceridemia and nerve oxidative stress at the dorsal root ganglia in mice and found that dyslipidemia leads to high levels of oxidised low-density lipoproteins that injure the dorsal root ganglia via lipoxygenase 1 receptor interactions contributing to the development of neuropathy.

The right lobe of the thyroid growing at the same time as the mediastinal mass may also help push it into the mediastinum. However, if the primary intrathoracic goitres usually have a relationship with the heart and main large vessels anatomically, this mass did not have a direct relationship with the heart and main mediastinal vascular structures.

Additionally, the use of cocaine with its potent vasoconstrictive effects has been implicated.
