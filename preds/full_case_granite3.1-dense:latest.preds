The rapidly falling requirements of insulin over the first few weeks in patients diagnosed with KPD should alert clinicians to consider this atypical form of diabetes. To predict insulin dependence, it is essential to assess pancreatic autoantibodies and function.\n\nPatients with KPD can be classified using the A\u03b2 system:\n\n1. A+ \u03b2- (type 1A diabetes mellitus): These patients have autoantibodies but absent \u03b2-cell function, requiring lifelong exogenous insulin therapy.\n2.

A+ \u03b2+ (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults): These patients have autoantibodies but preserved \u03b2-cell functional reserve; they will eventually lose their \u03b2-cell preserve and require lifelong exogenous insulin therapy.\n4. A- \u03b2+ (Flatbush DM): Patients without antibodies but with preserved \u03b2-cell functional reserve, the majority of whom can discontinue exogenous insulin therapy and be managed with oral hypoglycemic agents long term.\n\nThe pathophysiology of Flatbush diabetes involves glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity causing severe but partially reversible \u03b2-cell functional defects. Genetic susceptibility plays a role, with some studies finding an increased frequency of HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR4 in KPD patients compared to non-diabetic populations. The clinical presentation and natural course of the disease differ from typical DKA patients with type 1 DM, with most KPD patients being obese, middle-aged individuals presenting with unprovoked DKA.\n\nManagement of KPD involves acute management of hyperglycemia and ketosis/DKA, followed by long-term management after resolution of DKA. Assessment of \u03b2-cell functional reserve and autoimmunity should be performed 4-8 weeks after resolution of ketoacidosis to predict insulin dependence.
